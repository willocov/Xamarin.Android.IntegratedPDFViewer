# Xamarin.Android.IntegratedPDFViewer
A simple Xamarin Android application with an integrated PDF Viewer. 
PDF Viewer uses Mozilla's pdfjs library and a WebView to display local pdf files.
PDF Viewer was added to an existing application based off the Xamarin Tutorial Hello Android and PhoneWorld.

To implement code, add Mozilla's Pdf.js library to the assets folder.

Feel free to use this code!
